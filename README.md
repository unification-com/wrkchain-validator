# WRKChain Block Validator

The WRKChain Block Validator is a simple tool which can be run on any computer. It offers a simple UI
which can be used to validate a WRKChain's block hashes committed to its WRKCHain Root Smart Contract
counterpart on the UND Mainchain.

`WRKCHAIN_ROOT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address for your WRKCHain's deployed WRKChain Root Smart Contract  
`WRKCHAIN_ROOT_WRITE_TIMEOUT`: Frequency your WRKCHain Oracle writes hashes to the WRKCHain Root Smart Contract, in seconds  
`WRKCHAIN_WEB3_PROVIDER_URL`: The Web3 Provider URL for **your WRKCHain**  
`WRKCHAIN_VALIDATOR_SERVICE_PORT`: Port on which you would like this server to run. Optional - default is port 4040
